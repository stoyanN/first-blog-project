This is a Single Page Application - Blog 

1. I used Kinvey BaaS in order to be able to simulate real time website.
2. The pictures of Ryan are mine own pictures and the background and the other articles's photos are taken from www.unsplash.com.
3. To generate favicon I used www.favicon.io.
4. To launch the project I use VS Code Live Server.
