1. I used Kinvey BaaS in order to be able to simulate real time website. - Keep in mind that the Kinvey service will be available until 13th of July. After this date the website will not work properly.
2. The pictures of Ryan are mine own pictures and the background and the other articles's photos are taken from www.unsplash.com.
3. To generate favicon I used www.favicon.io.
4. To launch the project I use VS Code Live Server.
